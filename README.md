# Work Day Scheduler

To be used as a daily planner during business hours: 9am-5pm. Items can be added and saved to local storage

## In Progress

Soon: the scheduler will utilize Dayjs current date/time to determine if a time-block on the calendar is in the past, present or future. Time-blocks will be color coded accordingly.
